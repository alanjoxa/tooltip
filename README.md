tooltip
=======

A simple tooltip library in native javascript
A tooltip acan be added to all div nodes in an html by adding the attribute "hint" and the tooltip text as its value.

Also this library will provide all DIV nodes an extra api called tooltip.
So a ttoltip can be dynamically added to any div by calling and passing the tooltip to it.

Eg: document.querrySelector("#divID1").tooltip("tooltip text");
